//! WebSocket connection handler — manages the full lifecycle of a client connection.
//!
//! Each WebSocket connection spawns two tasks:
//!
//! 1. **Writer task** (`writer_loop`) — reads from the per-connection send
//!    channel and a control channel, serializes messages to JSON, and
//!    writes WebSocket text frames. Includes slow-client detection.
//!
//! 2. **Reader task** (`reader_loop`) — reads WebSocket frames, deserializes
//!    [`ClientMessage`]s, and handles auth, subscribe, unsubscribe, publish,
//!    and ping commands.
